## UI Design

- **Aiming for large image background with fixed Header and Footer and modal-based content.**
- **Feel Like an App, not a website, using SPA and Modal Management.**

### Login / Register Modal

- Simple, clean design with bright, noisy images full of color.
- The color scheme transitions from blue (signifying Common to Rare) to gold (Legendary to Mythic) across the screen, subtly indicating game progression.
- The UI should feel app-like, vibrant, and modern.
