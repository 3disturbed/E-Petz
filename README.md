## UI Design

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dd9102d-5d5c-4500-b026-2b2c7747d5b1)

- **Aiming for large image background with fixed Header and Footer and modal-based content.**
- **Feel Like an App, not a website, using SPA and Modal Management.**

### Login / Register Modal

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4d585c-ac95-4daf-a6c0-070daf3b9e81)

- Simple, clean design with bright, noisy images full of color.
- The color scheme transitions from blue (signifying Common to Rare) to gold (Legendary to Mythic) across the screen, subtly indicating game progression.
- The UI should feel app-like, vibrant, and modern.
